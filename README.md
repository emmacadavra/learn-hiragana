# **Learn Hiragana & Katakana**
## **Site Overview**
According to the [**U.S. Department of State's *Foreign Language Institute***](https://www.state.gov/foreign-language-training/), the Japanese language is one of five languages considered exceptionally difficult for native English speakers - taking, on average, around 2,200 hours (the equivalent of 6 years if a person were to practise for 1 hour every day) to achieve proficiency. This is, in no small part, due to Japan's use of three separate alphabets. While the largest and most complex alphabet used in Japan, named *kanji*, is made up of characters that are Chinese in origin, the remaining 2, named *hiragana* and *katakana* are unique to Japan and form the basis for all Japanese words. In fact, Japanese children are taught to read and write hiragana and katakana from a young age, and knowledge of both is a necessary prerequisite to being introduced to kanji steadily across 9 years of mandatory education.

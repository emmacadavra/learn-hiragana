# **Learn Hiragana & Katakana**
## **Site Overview**
According to the [**U.S. Department of State's *Foreign Language Institute***](https://www.state.gov/foreign-language-training/), the Japanese language is one of five languages considered exceptionally difficult for native English speakers - taking, on average, around 2,200 hours (the equivalent of 6 years if a person were to practise for 1 hour every day) to achieve proficiency. This is, in no small part, due to Japan's use of three separate alphabets. While the largest and most complex alphabet used in Japan, named *kanji*, is made up of characters that are Chinese in origin, the remaining 2, named *hiragana* and *katakana* are unique to Japan and form the basis for all Japanese words. Japanese children are taught to read and write hiragana and katakana from a young age, and knowledge of both is a necessary prerequisite to being introduced to kanji steadily across 9 years of mandatory education.

In a similar way, it is necessary for anyone learning Japanese to recognise both the hiragana and katakana alphabets, as - technically speaking - the entire language could be written in just one or both of them (although, practically speaking, this would be a terrible idea!)

With Japanese being such a difficult language to learn for native English speakers, practise may never equal *perfect*, but practise WILL make *progress*, and gamifying that practise makes learning all the more fun.

### **Colour Scheme**

This website’s colour scheme was inspired by the following colour palette created by [**akula creative**](https://akulakreative.com/blog/2016/02/a-sea-and-space-inspired-color-palette) based on an image posted by NASA.

Japan is an island nation, so I wanted to include colours that the user can associate with the ocean, and serenity. The inclusion of the gold colour was something I intended on from the start, as it is inspired by the Japanese practice of [**Kintsugi (金継ぎ, "golden joinery")**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintsugi).

Below are two colour grids to show how the colours interact with each other from an accessibility perspective - one with just the main site colours, and the other with the additional colours used in the “correct” and “incorrect” classes when taking the quiz itself.

#### **Header**

The header can be found at the top of all three pages of the website, and is very simple in its design. It includes the site title in a centred position, using the font I chose for the logo-style text. No additional styling was added in CSS (such as hover styling), to give the impression that the text is an image logo.The header is responsive, but care was taken to make sure that it never takes up too much of the screen, so that the main page content is what sticks out the most to the user. Due to the more simplistic style of this website, the header does not include a navigation bar, but clicking on the site title will take you to the homepage, as the user would expect. The decision not to include a navigation bar was made due to there being a “Back to Game Menu” button below the game area on each page that is clear and intuitive, and allowed the option of including the Japanese text.

#### **Footer**

The footer also appears on all three pages of the website and contains a small amount of text explaining the purpose of the website. Initially, this was all, but the decision was made to also include a disclaimer stating that the website is for education purposes only.

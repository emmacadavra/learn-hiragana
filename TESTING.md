## Testing Throughout Development

### Overview

During the development of this project, I manually tested the wesbite and its code primarily by using the 'python3 -m http.server' command in GitPod and CodeAnywhere's VSCode workspace, which created a love instance of the website that updated in real time every time I saved my code within the IDE. My default browser is Google Chrome, so I also heavily utilised Chrome's DevTools to allow me to test the site's responsive design, tweak elements of the code for bug fixing purposes, and crucially to use the console to aid me in creating JavaScript functions.

When the website itself was more or less "put together", I deployed it to GitHub pages so that I could test it not only in my own testing environment, but also in a live environment. This proved useful on several occasions - for example, while I received no errors for my favicon's site.webmanifest file in my testing environment, I did receive the following console error on the deployed GitHub Pages website:

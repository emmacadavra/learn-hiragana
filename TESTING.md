## Testing Throughout Development

### Overview

During the development of this project, I manually tested the wesbite and its code primarily by using the 'python3 -m http.server' command in GitPod and CodeAnywhere's VSCode workspace, which created a love instance of the website that updated in real time every time I saved my code within the IDE. My default browser is Google Chrome, so I also heavily utilised Chrome's DevTools to allow me to test the site's responsive design, tweak elements of the code for bug fixing purposes, and crucially to use the console to aid me in creating JavaScript functions.
